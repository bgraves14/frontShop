## Issues

For this project I wanted to try a new technology that I have heard about called Moltin, it is a great piece of technology for building an eCommerce website that I really would recommend people try out. As im sure you know learning and implementing a new technology takes some time to get used to which you will see in the following. 

I am currently in contact with Moltin about getting my discounts working, Moltin has great documentation but I seem to have fallen into a strange area and this should be fixed very shortly.

As I took this project on a more adventurous approach, I do not have a product that is perfect and finished but instead something that was quite interesting and a great learning experience.

Expect a very nice and polished project to come in the next few days!
